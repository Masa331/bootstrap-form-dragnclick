# Bootstrap 4 visual form builder

Forms are essential for every web app. This tool shows what kind of form is possible to build with bootstrap.

## Road to 1.0.0

- [x] All input attributes edit working
- [x] Input add
- [ ] Valid html generated - almost there! :)

## Features

**This is work-in-progress and it covers only basics now. For full info check original [Bootstrap docs](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/).**

- ~~search, email, url, tel, month, and week input types~~ - left out on purpose

## Why

I Started this because:

* I love [Bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/). However, because i'm not a frontend guy, i sometimes get lost somewhere inside it's vast possibilities.
* I wanted to learn [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and this seems like a perfect project for it. I like to learn on practical things.
