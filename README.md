# Bootstrap 4 visual form builder[WIP]

Forms are essential for every web app. This tool quickly shows what's possible in Bootstrap.

**This is work-in-progress and it doesn't cover everything from Bootstrap. For full info please check original [docs](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/).**

## How to

Just visit here: <https://masa331.github.io/bootstrap-form-dragnclick/> and play :)

## Development

I Started this because:

* I love [Bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/). However, because i'm not a frontend guy, i sometimes get lost somewhere inside it's vast possibilities.
* I wanted to learn [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and this seems like a perfect project for it. I like to learn on practical things.
