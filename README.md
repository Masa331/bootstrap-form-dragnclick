# Bootstrap 4 visual form builder

Forms are essential for every web app. This tool shows what kind of form is possible to build with bootstrap.

**This is work-in-progress and it covers only basics now. For full info check original [Bootstrap docs](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/).**

## Road to 2.0.0

- [] Horizontal forms

## What's not included

- search, email, url, tel, month, and week input types
- readonly

## Why

I Started this because:

* I love [Bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/). However, because i'm not a frontend guy, i sometimes get lost somewhere inside it's vast possibilities.
* I wanted to learn [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and this seems like a perfect project for it. I like to learn on practical things.
